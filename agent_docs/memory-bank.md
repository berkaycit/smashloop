## List

- **Summary**: Implement basic breakout game
- **Description**: Replaced template Phaser scene with a full breakout game. Game.ts rewritten with paddle (mouse-controlled), bouncing ball, 10x5 brick grid with row-colored tints, score/lives UI, and a state machine (idle/playing/gameOver/win). Textures generated at runtime via Graphics. Arcade physics added to main.ts config. Initial ball speed set to 700 px/s with x1.02 multiplier per brick hit.
